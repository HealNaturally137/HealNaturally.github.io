Our App displays ads using Google AdMob.
AdMob may collect certain information automatically, such as device identifiers and interaction with ads, in order to show relevant content.

Google may use the advertising ID from your device.

Depending on your location, you may see personalized or non-personalized ads.

Ads shown in the App are served directly by Google AdMob, which may process data as described in their policies.

You can manage your advertising preferences through your device settings (limit ad tracking / reset advertising ID).

In some regions, you may be presented with a consent form to choose between personalized and non-personalized ads.
