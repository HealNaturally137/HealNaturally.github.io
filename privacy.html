    <h1>Privacy Policy for the Heal Naturally App</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 24/09/2025</em></p>

    <p>Heal Naturally will always respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application handles information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users of this App.</p>

    <h2>2. Advertising (AdMob)</h2>
    <p>Our App displays ads using Google AdMob. AdMob may collect certain information automatically, such as device identifiers and interaction with ads, in order to show relevant content.</p>
    <p>Google may use the advertising ID from your device.</p>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may see personalized or non-personalized ads.</p>
    <p>We configure AdMob to request non-personalized ads where required by law (such as in the EU and UK).</p>
    <p>For more details on how Google uses data in AdMob, please see: 
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a> and 
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">How Google uses information from apps</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not directed to children under 13 (or under the minimum age in your country). We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your information with any third parties.</p>
    <p>Ads shown in the App are served directly by Google AdMob, which may process data as described in their policies.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can manage your advertising preferences through your device settings (limit ad tracking / reset advertising ID).</p>
    <p>In some regions, you may be presented with a consent form to choose between personalized and non-personalized ads.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted within the App or on this page.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
